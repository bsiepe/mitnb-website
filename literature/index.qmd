Although ecological momentary assessment (EMA) allows for rich insights into dynamic psychological processes, measurement issues, including reactivity, reliability, validity, and feedback mechanisms, pose significant methodological challenges. Importantly, recent work by [**Vogelsmeier et al. (2024)**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-024-03678-0) shows that measurement practices in EMA, such as using validated items or assessing reliability, are not regularly done, often because researchers do not know how to approach such methodological questions. In the past years, members of the MITNB consortium have made substantial contributions to improve the quality of measurement in EMA. Some of this work is highlighted on this page.

## Methodological Best Practices

Well-designed EMA studies depend on choosing what to measure, how often, and how to maintain psychometric rigor. These two papers are summaries of current state-of-the art practices.

## Reactivity, Invariance & Response Quality in EMA

Although repeated assessments provide rich data, they can influence how participants respond, leading to phenomena such as measurement reactivity and careless responding. These papers summarize the issue and point towards analytical solutions to deal with them.

## Validation of EMA Items

Although EMA is widely used in psychological research, rigorous validation of constructs remains underdeveloped. Many studies rely on items that have not undergone thorough psychometric evaluation. A first good start is to scan the [ESM item repository](https://esmitemrepositoryinfo.com/). The following contributions help in assessing what a good item is and how mixed-methods approaches can help reveal problems with validity in EMA research.

## Reliability & Validity of EMA Data

Assessing psychometric properties in EMA studies is complicated by the dynamic nature of emotions and behaviors. These papers describe multiple ways to assess reliability and validity in EMA data and show two recent examples of EMA questionnaires that were validated using multiple methods.

## Design Features: Sampling Strategies & Item Design

The quality of EMA data depends not only on what is measured, but also when, how often, and how items are presented. These papers investigate how these choices can impact data quality and provide guidelines for designing EMA studies.

## Beyond Rating Scales: Capturing Daily Life Complexity

EMA typically uses standard ratings scales, but such scales often miss important nuances. These tutorial papers show different methods beyond standard rating scales to better capture the complexity of daily life.
