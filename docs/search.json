    "text": "Response Processes in ESM Studies\nPrinciple Investigator: Dominique Maciejewski (Homepage)\nResearcher: Leonie Schorlepp\nCollaborators: Miguel Silan, Eiko Fried, Laura Bringmann\nDescription: The Experience Sampling Method (ESM), a technique to study emotions in daily life, is booming among researchers and clinicians. To justify its use, valid measurements are crucial, but recently concerns about the validity of ESM have been voiced. An important source of validity evidence are the response processes that individuals engage in when answering questions about their emotions, specifically how they interpret and respond to these questions. Remarkably, we know very little about the exact response processes in emotion measurement in ESM studies. More importantly, there are concerns that participants are not consistent over time and differ from each other in how they interpret and respond to questions about their emotions. The current project proposes a person-specific approach to identify how individuals interpret and respond to questions about their emotions in ESM studies. Specifically, it will identify how consistent individuals are over time and how they differ from each other in these response processes. Results will generate new hypotheses regarding response processes and provide practical implications for researchers and clinicians using ESM."

Importantly, recent work by Vogelsmeier et al. (2024) shows that measurement practices in EMA, such as using validated items or assessing reliability, are not regularly done, often because researchers do not know how to approach such methodological questions. In the past years, members of the MITNB consortium have made substantial contributions to improve the quality of measurement in EMA. Some of this work is highlighted on this page."

    "text": "Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) have gained tremendous popularity in studying dynamic processes in daily life. In ESM, individuals rate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviours multiple times per day across days, weeks or months using smartphone apps. The data obtained with ESM allow zooming into dynamic processes as they unfold in real time in daily life. Due to technological advances of the past decades, ESM research is booming in research (Myin-Germeys et al., 2018) and has found its way into clinical practice (Mestdagh et al., 2022).\nTo justify the use of ESM, valid measurements are crucial. Surprisingly, in contrast to a long history of psychometric evaluations regarding relatively stable traits (e.g., intelligence), much less attention has been paid to measurement in ESM (Kuppens et al., 2022). Along with good theory, proper measurement is imperative to drawing valid conclusions (Flake & Fried, 2020).\nAs a response to this lack of research focusing on validity and reliability, we formed the “Measurement is the New Black” (MITNB) consortium in 2022. The MITNB is an interdisciplinary consortium consisting of international researchers and clinicians, with expertise in quantitative statistics, qualitative methods, philosophy of science, clinical and developmental psychology that aims to improve the validity and reliability of ESM in the social sciences. Together, we come up with innovative ways to address core questions, such as:\nWe have a strong motivation to feed our results back to the scientific and clinical community. Thus, in the upcoming decade we will not only conduct a number of studies on psychometrics in ESM, but also summarise concrete recommendations on how to better measure in ESM research."

    "text": "MITNB meeting 2024\nThe first MITNB meeting was organized as an NWO-funded Lorentz workshop, held from November 4–8, 2024, in Leiden, the Netherlands. The focus of the meeting was on the integration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to improve Ecological Momentary Assessment.\nThe meeting opened with a keynote by Prof. Denny Borsboom, who gave a state-of-the-art presentation about how important theory is to understand measurement and the potential of formal modeling as an important thinking tool.\nMoreover, we offered four hands-on workshops designed to introduce different qualitative and computational approaches. Those included:\n\nCognitive Interviewing: A Gentle Introduction to Qualitative Data Collection (Miguel Silan & Leonie Schorrlepp)\nReflexivity and Triangulation in ESM: Questioning the Questions (Femke Truijens & Melissa de Smet)\nTextual Data in ESM: Using a New Shiny App for Open-Ended Responses (Marie Stadel)\nComputational Linguistic Techniques for Text Data Analysis (Katie Hoeman)\n\nWe also had two roundtable panel sessions which explored critical methodological themes:\n\nIntegrating qualitative with quantitative methods as the future of measurement?\nPanelists: Shirley Wang, Leonie Vogelsmeier, Miriam Hehlmann, Freek Oude Maatman, Katie Hoeman\nFormalization as the Future of Measurement?\nPanelists: Markus Eronen, Marieke Helmich, Jonas Haslbeck, Fred Hasselman\n\nA main part of the meeting were the hackathons, during which participants worked on concrete measurement issues. Examples of these topics were: differences in interpretations of PHQ-9 items, real-time dynamics of response processes during emotion rating, and the accuracy and consistency of Visual Analog Scales (VAS).\nThe meeting facilitated in-depth methodological exchange, fostered interdisciplinary collaboration, and led to several newly initiated joint research projects. Please see the Literature Overview for some of the outputs.\n\nPhotos from MITNB workshop 2024\n\n\n\nAll participants of the MITNB workshop 2024 in Leiden, the Netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\nKeynote by Denny Boorsboom on the state-of-the-art on measurement\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking the ice activity\n\n\n\n\n\nHackathon on exploring response processes in ESM\n\n\n\n\n\nRoundtable discussion on qualitative versus quantiative methods\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing team of the MITNB annual meeting 2024"

This year’s workshop focuses on thinking about and modeling reliability and different time scales in ESM research. Key issues include modeling the process at the timescale at which it is theorized to unfold, matching this with the timescale at which the process is measured, and relating processes unfolding at different timescales.
