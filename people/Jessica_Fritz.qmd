## Position

Senior Postdoctoral Research Fellow & Psychotherapist Trainee

## Institution

University of Osnabrück

## Research Interests

By bringing together quantitative and qualitative research methods for intensive longitudinal data, I aim to study a) what components – in addition to psycho(patho)logical symptoms – are particularly relevant for a meaningful "mental health" assessment, b) how these components can be captured with monitoring and outcome tools, and c) how we can best add personalized components to these monitoring and outcome tools. My hope is that this line of research can eventually enable a comprehensive and personally-relevant mental health assessment for psychosocial intervention settings.
