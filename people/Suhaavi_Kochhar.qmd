## Position

PhD candidate

## Institution

Radboud University

## Research Interests

I’m interested in making mental health interventions engaging and accessible through digital methods. To do this effectively, we need to improve how we measure complex, subjective experiences. Thus, I’m especially interested in finding better ways to assess these kinds of latent constructs.
