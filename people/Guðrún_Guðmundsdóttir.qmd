## Position

PhD student

## Institution

Maastricht University

## Research Interests

I'm interested in all things ESM, particularly in response processes (e.g., how do people interpret and use slider scales?), time-scale considerations (e.g., how frequently should we measure a construct based on its variability in daily life?), and the why and how of using open-text responses (e.g., what is the added value of written responses beyond what we can infer from closed items?).
